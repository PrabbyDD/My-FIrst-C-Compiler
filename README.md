My first time writing a compiler - mostly to improve my knowledge of low level coding and C++.
Motivated by this guide from Pixeled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcSijrRsrY0&list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs&index=1
and berkeley's CS164 course https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/fa22/schedule.html\

Will not be trying to make an optimal and majorly useable language, but just for learning purposes. 

Things left to finish before i am satisfied with this project for now:
  - Floating point arithmetic
  - Basic functions
  - Basic pointers 
  - Maybe something wack
  - refactoring some code and writing cleaner educational comments in compiler code and annotating assembly with comments
  - Maybe a quick video or write up
  - add to website
