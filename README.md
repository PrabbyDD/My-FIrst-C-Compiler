My first time writing a compiler - mostly to improve my knowledge of low level coding and C++.
Guided by this series from Pixeled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcSijrRsrY0&list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs&index=1
and berkeley's CS164 course https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/fa22/schedule.html\ 

Will not be trying to make an optimal and majorly useable language, but just for learning purposes. Also this currently only runs on linux. 

To run on your linux machine, pull the repo and run:
  - 

Things left to finish before i am satisfied with this project for now:
  - Floating point arithmetic
  - Basic functions
  - Basic pointers 
  - Maybe something wack
  - Maybe a quick video or write up
  - add to my website as project
  - write how to run on your local machine
